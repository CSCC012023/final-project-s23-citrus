### Q1: What are you planning to build?
We are planning to build an experience based, social meetup web application. Our aim is to connect individuals who are interested in specific events but lack companionship.

### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)
Persona 1 - Alice

Alice is a 20 year old student, currently in her second year of university. She aims to get into a biomedical engineering program, so she often stays on top of her work while balancing a part-time job as a cashier to earn some cash to help pay for her textbooks. Recently, she has been able to save enough money to go to an upcoming concert, but her friends (mostly in her program) are swamped with work and are unable to go with her. Alice doesn't want to go alone, but really wants to attend.

Persona 2 - Alex

Alex is a 38 year old baseball enthusiast living in the Bronx who recently bought two tickets to a game at Yankee Stadium for him and his friend, who's planning to fly over from Ohio. He works as a financial advisor in Scotiabank and has a wife and two kids, the latter of which he brings to baseball games on the weekends. Recently, he's received unfortunate news from his friend that his flight the day before has been delayed, so he won't be able to make it in time to watch the game. Alex is still planning to attend, but doesn't want the ticket to go to waste.

Persona 3 - Carl

Carl is a 17 year old student currently in their third year of high school. He's incredibly focused on getting admitted to the University of Waterloo for Computer Science, and has made it a goal to attend as many programming events as possible to put them on his application. One such event, Hack the North, has an application process that Carl was fortunate enough to get accepted through. While he's incredibly enthusiastic about attending, his high school is relatively smaller in size, and no one else from it applied or was accepted, leaving him without a group.

### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
Let's consider a scenario where a user desires to attend a concert but hesitates to go alone. Our app will enable them to connect with like-minded users who have also experienced similar discouragement due to the absence of companions. By facilitating these connections, our app not only allows users to forge new friendships with shared interests but also benefits from the potential attendance of two individuals who might have otherwise opted out.

### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team?
We consider 'done' as the project owner being satisfied with the final result (i.e. all of the required user stories have been implemented and fully functioning). We also must be thorough with reviewing/testing our code to ensure consistency and stability, as well as make sure that the project meets the requirements of Scalability, Availability, Maintenance, and Portability (Non-Functional Requirements). Lastly, we want to ensure that we meet the requirements of the sprints/phases set out to us by this course. 

### Highlights

1. Although we ended up choosing GoGo, there were certainly other alternatives we were considering, like Hype and Artillect. However, we went through all of the projects provided and narrowed our final decision down for the following reasons.
    -In addition to allowing organizers to add events they wanted users to attend, we could collect events from bigger sites (e.g. TicketMaster) using their APIs and deliver those so the site isn't barren and populated with test events
    -Very little storage overhead to deal with compared to Artillect, Hype & Ascend - they would be heavy on content delivery systems
    -There are opportunities to work in monetization from the get-go (GoGo Premium or something of the sort)
    -There are also opportunities for some kind of AI-based recommendation system

2. We decided to split the team in half to work on Front-End and Back-End. The front-end team, currently working on Figma consists of Aaliyah, Sana, and Shinza, while the back-end team consists of Daniel, Ishaan, Matthew, and Miraj, who are currently working with Next.js and SQL. Since those sub-groups were able to meet and converse more frequently together, we thought that it would allow the project's development to thrive if both ends could discuss with one another aside from our team meetings.

3. Our decision was to hold team meetings once a week on Wednesday at 3:00 PM. It was a reasonable time where everyone could meet up at the campus without interfering with anyone's schedule, as well as allowing us to discuss what we had done the days prior to the meeting before sharing what our plans were for the days to come in the week. The format of our meetings would have both front-end and back-end catch the other up on what they had been up to, before discussing team-relevant problems (such as Q4 of product.md). Afterwards, we would brief each other on what we planned to work on leading up to the next meeting.
