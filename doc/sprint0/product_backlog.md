# Product Backlog

Working with the information provided by the LIME Founder, alongside the project description given in class, our team has created a series of stories to depict what actions can be taken upon the completion of our project. Considering that our website targets both event attendees as well as event organizers, we have catered specific stories to target both demographics.

All user stories have been documented in JIRA in preparation for Sprint 1.
