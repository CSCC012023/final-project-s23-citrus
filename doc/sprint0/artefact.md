## Artefact

Our team has created a prototype to display the functionality of the web application. This design was created on Figma, depicting the core functionalities of our project. The user begins at the login page, then has options to sift through existing events and find like-minded individuals to attend these events with. We have provided mockups of the interface for both users interested interacting with other event attendees alongside businesses who want to advertise their events and begin the networking process.
