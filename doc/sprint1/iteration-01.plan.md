## Product

#### Goals and tasks

**Goals:**
 * Create a landing page for users first visting the website, with a link to the sign-up page and a link to the login page
   * Properly define a description of our app for end users
 * Sign-in page for users to create accounts for themselves, with emails associated, focus on security
   * Learn about how to hash and store passwords, how to securely send data
 * Events page for users to browse events and indicate interest in them
   * Learn how to do dynamic page generation based on list of objects 

**Tasks common to all goals:**
* Set up database schema (users, events, organizer data models) and API endpoints 
for most use cases (search, create, update, delete)


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

  * Artifacts we currently have include a Figma mockup to create a logical framework for the tasks users can expect to accomplish in each app area, enabling a quick
  non-technical overview
  * Have live production deployments (off Github main branch) to Vercel, which auto-build on merge so our latest changes are always presentable
  * Detailed description of frontend and backend, such as API documentation, so that an overall picture of the application's stack and communication strategy is easily understandable
