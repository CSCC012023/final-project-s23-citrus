# Eventual

## Iteration 04

 * Start date: Jul 25, 2023
 * End date: Aug 4, 2023

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * Team members are now encouraged to take on more monolithic tickets with
 more story points assigned. This is to minimize the number of tickets assigned
 to different people with cross-team-member dependencies
 * Encouraging team members to ask more questions as the functionality each
 person is working on for this sprint is much more complex than the previous
 sprints

#### Roles & responsibilities

Similarly to the previous two iterations, all team members will be working full stack developers for this sprint and as such there are no unique roles and responsibilities for development work. Each of our full-stack developers will be responsible for:

* Developing user-friendly interfaces using our front-end tooling, such as TailwindCSS and Next.js 
* Managing databases directly through the use of Prisma
* Creating and modifying API endpoints to support front-end functionality through Next.js API routes. 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

We are planning to have at least one in-person meeting on Wednesdays at 3pm in BV. The goal of the meeting will be to summarize and debug and go over any issues that come up. We will also have a weekly online meeting on Saturday for a quick sync-up. We also will have daily stand ups on Slack to keep track of progress and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. The main assignee and co-collaborator for each story will keep in communication on what is being done.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.

The following below are continuing to be used from last sprint:       

 * We will be providing a burndown chart as well as a dependency graph to maintain organization.
 * We will provide similar plan and review documents
