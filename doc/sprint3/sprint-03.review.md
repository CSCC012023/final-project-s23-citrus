## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 2023-07-21
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * The decision to more rigorously document our code turned out well as it allowed us to better understand
 each component of the codebase, without having to pause work to ask someone else for information
 * Having more frequent meetings allowed us to better communicate with each other and help each other complete our 
 tasks

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * The decision to not actively emphasize work on easier tickets earlier resulted in a huge backlog of simpler tickets at the end of the sprint, which could have caused an even bigger gap between our planned velocity and actual velocity had we not worked fast under pressure
 * We didn't enforce daily standups to be posted on schedule which resulted in team members not getting help when
 help may have been needed
### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Enforce daily standups
 * We are planning to have an MVP (with simpler tickets finished) done by the first week so if any polishing is required, we will be able to focus on the remaining work on the latter week without deadline issues

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 * Users can now create events (also revamped the event creation layout)
 * Managing events (viewing, filtering, editing, deleting) is now possible for both users and organizers
 * Viewing Interested Users (organizers and users alike)
 * Users being able to see their events and interested events

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
 * Messaging system
 * Ticket system (with QR codes)
 * Profile system

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Emphasizing that team members should work on simpler tickets first, much in the same way that students should do the easier questions on an exam first, leaving the harder questions for the remainder of the time. This will minimize crunch time issues that we encountered in the current sprint, where several tickets that would otherwise be low-hanging fruit were completed in the last 2 days of the sprint. 

 * Having daily check-ins with other team members, regardless of whether or not they've posted their standups for the day, is important. Without context on what issues other team members might be facing, it's impossible to help them and get their tickets finished. Obviously standups should be the primary way of communicating this, but since teammates are juggling lots of responsibilities, it can be hard to remember to post unless someone explicitly reminds you.
