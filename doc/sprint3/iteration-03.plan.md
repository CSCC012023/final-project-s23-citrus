# Eventual

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Jul 11, 2023
 * End date: Jul 21, 2023

## Process
#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * We are increasing the amount of documentation we write for this project, including improved PR messages, documentation for large changes to code structure, and 
    * As a success metric, any member of the group should be able to explain what any part of the code does, and have reduced issues onboarding members to new branchs.
 * We are setting up subtasks for user stories
    * one subtask for development
    * one subtask for review (testing)
 * We will have more frequent meetings to review changes, and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This includes:
    * (at least) one meeting a week to go over summarizing/debugging(relaying what has been accomplished in the past week/addressing specific code-related issues on either end)
    * (at least) one meeting a week to go over team/project issues(sprint pacing, current focuses, next steps)

#### Roles & responsibilities

Similarly to the previous iteration, all team members will be working full stack developers for this sprint and as such there are no unique roles and responsibilities for development work. Each of our full-stack developers will be responsible for:

* Developing user-friendly interfaces using our front-end tooling, such as TailwindCSS and Next.js 
* Managing databases directly through the use of Prisma
* Creating and modifying API endpoints to support front-end functionality through Next.js API routes. 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

We are planning to have at least one in-person meeting on Wednesdays at 3pm in BV. The goal of the meeting will be to summarize and debug and go over any issues that . We will also have a weekly online meetings on Saturday for a quick sync-up. We also will have daily stand ups on Slack to keep track of progress and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. The main assignee and co-collaborator for each story will keep in communication on what is being done. 


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * We will be providing a burndown chart as well as a dependency graph to maintain organization.
 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Same Git workflow as previous sprint, but with increased focus on naming branches and PRs based on associated tickets.


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._


#### Goals and tasks

The main goal of this iteration is to implement more of the core functionality of our website, including:

 * Viewing Interested Users(organizers and users alike)
 * Viewing Interested Events(for users)
 * Revamping event creation layout
 * Allowing users to follow each other and view profiles
 * ~~Building chat functionality~~ (was too large in scope for this sprint)

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Create an 'edit event' page for users to edit events they've created, and organizers editing any/ all events
 
 * Create a 'create new event page' that allows organizers to create new events

 * Create a 'search by date and time' filter for users to search for events in a specific time frame

 * Create a page for users to view only the events they are interested in attending to better keep track

 * Modify and create a separate event description page for users and organizers in order for them to view the list of attending users and distribute info/message to meet up
