 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 03

 * Start date: Jul 11, 2023
 * End date: Jul 21, 2023

## Process

Quick Introduction to the process

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * We are increasing the amount of documentation we write for this project, including improved PR messages, documentation for large changes to code structure, and 
    * As a success metric, any member of the group should be able to explain what any part of the code does, and have reduced issues onboarding members to new branchs.
 * We are setting up subtasks for user stories
    * one subtask for development
    * one subtask for review (testing)
 * We will have more frequent meetings to review changes, and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This includes:
    * (at least) one meeting a week to go over summarizing/debugging(relaying what has been accomplished in the past week/addressing specific code-related issues on either end)
    * (at least) one meeting a week to go over team/project issues(sprint pacing, current focuses, next steps)

 > *Note:* If you are not making any changes to your process, it means that you are happy with all of the decisions you made in the previous iterations.
 > In this case, list what you consider to be the most significant process decisions your team made. For each decision, explain why you consider it successful, and what success metric you are using (or could use) to assert that the decision is successful.


#### Roles & responsibilities

Similarly to the previous iteration, all team members will be working full stack developers for this sprint and as such there are no unique roles and responsibilities for development work. Each of our full-stack developers will be responsible for:

* Developing user-friendly interfaces using our front-end tooling, such as TailwindCSS and Next.js 
* Managing databases directly through the use of Prisma
* Creating and modifying API endpoints to support front-end functionality through Next.js API routes. 

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

We are planning to have at least one in-person meeting on Wednesdays at 3pm in BV. The goal of the meeting will be to summarize and debug and go over any issues that . We will also have a weekly online meetings on Saturday for a quick sync-up. We also will have daily stand ups on Slack to keep track of progress and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. The main assignee and co-collaborator for each story will keep in communication on what is being done. 


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * We will be providing a burndown chart as well as a dependency graph to maintain organization.
 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Same Git workflow as previous sprint, but with increased focus on naming branches and PRs based on associated tickets.


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._


#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
